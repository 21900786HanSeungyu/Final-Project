**What does this project do?**

This is the website for the travelors.
They can plan a trip with the useful information in this site.

**Why is this project useful?**

I believe this site is userful for the travelors.
When I plan a trip, I always have hard time searching for the information seperately. 
However, since the informaion is collected and linked in this one site, people will feel easier to plan a trip.

**How do I get started?** 

To begin with, you should install wordpress in your raspberrypi server. 
https://respectedb.tistory.com/entry/라즈베리파이-워드프레스-설치 (I used this site to install wordpress)

After you install wordpress, you are ready to make your website. 
You can modify and add the functions with HTML codes OR CSS codes in your site. 

**what I added in my website**
I changed CSS code in order to change the color of the site.
I added HTML code in the post I have written.(This is imagemap for the map image that I used to link the other sites.) 
--> HTML codes are in the source file.

**Where can I get more help, if I need it?**

You can email me (21900786@handong.edu)
Or search for the information on wordpress.org .
